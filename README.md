 Automation Testing with Selnium in Java
 
Selenium Java Maven Project
This is a Selenium project using Java and Maven. It includes a number of sample test cases that demonstrate how to use Selenium to automate web browsers.

Prerequisites
In order to run the tests in this project, you will need the following software installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Maven
Running the Tests
To run the tests, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run the following command to build the project and download any required dependencies:

mvn clean install

Once the build is complete, run the following command to execute the test cases:

mvn test

Customizing the Tests
You can customize the tests by modifying the src/test/java directory. This directory contains the test cases and the test data they use.

To add a new test case, create a new Java class in the src/test/java directory and define a test method using the @Test annotation. You can then use the Selenium API to interact with the web browser and perform the desired actions.
